# Group-5-Creation/ FRONT-END INTERACTIVE UI


### Project Requirements
* We are task to build a web application that
use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap. 
* The application should be deployed to GitHub Pages. It should be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
* We are asked to use at least two server-side APIs.
* We should not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).
* The application should have client-side storage to store persistent data, be responsive and have a polished UI/User Interface.
* It should have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
* The application should have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).


## Built with:

* HTML - We used to layout the interface of the website with a touch of Bootstrap
* CSS - We used to style the website, like colors, margins, paddings and adjusting the designs for the application
* Javascript - We used this language to manipulate the inputs, data to display and supports the HTML and CSS functionalities.
* Third party API - We used this source to retrieved data and informations about our website
* Bootstrap/Mediaqueries - We used this CDN to help us build a responsive design
* Git/Github - We used this application to work together or collaborate in build this project

### USER STORY

* AS A Movie Lover
* I WANT to see different plot of movies and their ratings 
* SO THAT I can plan the next movie to watch

* Given a user searches for a movie information through an input form
* WHEN I search for a movie title
* THEN I am presented with movie poster, plot and rating reviews for that movie and that movie is added to the search history
* WHEN I search for another movie title 
* THEN the previous movie display will disappear and will be replaced by new movie with poster, plot and ratings
* WHEN I click on a movie title in the search history
* THEN I am again presented with the poster, plot and ratings of that certain movie
